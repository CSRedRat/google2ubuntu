Welcome to google2ubuntu's documentation!
=========================================

The aim of this project is to let you use the Google speech recognition API 
to control your linux computer. The project is developed in Python. 
google2ubuntu is a tool that I started 2 years ago. Unfortunatly, I was 
not able to do what I wanted because of a lack of time. So the project 
consists in 2 principal Python scripts:

* google2ubuntu.py
* google2ubuntu-manager.py

The first one lets you sends commands to Google and then execute some 
actions. The second one lets you manage all the commands. I've done huge 
efforts to make the program easy to install and easy to use. Besides, 
the program can be internationalize, for the moment, it is already 
available in French and English.
