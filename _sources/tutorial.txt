google2ubuntu is available on Github on the `releases <https://github.com/benoitfragit/google2ubuntu/releases>`_ page 
and in my `ppa <https://launchpad.net/~benoitfra/+archive/google2ubuntu>`_

	1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:benoitfra/google2ubuntu
	2. sudo apt-get update
	3. sudo apt-get install google2ubuntu

First launch
------------
Once you have installed google2ubuntu, you can attribute a shortcut to those 2 Python scripts:

``/usr/share/google2ubuntu/google2ubuntu.py``
``/usr/share/google2ubuntu/google2ubuntu-manager.py``

Moreover, if you search in the application's menu you will find two launchers, one for each of those programs.

After that, you can launch `google2ubuntu-manager.py <http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1391509665.png>`_ 
in order to manage all commands.

As you can see, google2ubuntu comes with several default commands. I will explain you how to manage and add commands.
